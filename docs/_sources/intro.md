__About the author__
Currently enrolled as a master student at the Oeschger Center for Climate Change Research at the Universität Bern, I previously worked in international development and studied economics. I obtained the first level *Bellis* certificate from the Swiss Botanical Society in July 2021. Part of this project was done in collaboration with Port 34 (Equipe Volo at the time).

__Contents__

* Part 1 (analysis.ipynb) summarizes the results of the plant surveys in 2020 and 2021
* Part 2 (germination.ipynb) presents the results of a germination experiment run on native wildflowers
* Part 3 (resources.ipynb) concludes this report, proposes next steps and acknowledges key regional and national resources.


This page is under development and the final version will be frozen in February 2022. A complete French translation of this report will be available as a .pdf download shortly thereafter.

__Special Thanks__

A very big thank you to Julia Bäuerlein for advice and knowledge about the horticulture of local wildflowers. Also, thank you to hammerdirt, without whom the analysis and presentation of the data would not have been possible.
