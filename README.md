# The plants of Biel/Bienne and a little bit of how to grow them.

This repository stores data and analysis for a series of 2020-2021 plant surveys around Biel/Bienne, Switzerland and a small germination experiment on some local wildflower seeds.

This repository builds the Jupyter Book available through the following dedicated link: https://thorerismann.github.io/hdbot/

## Files
The Jupyter Book is divided into the following sections:
* Part 1 (analysis.ipynb) summarizes the results of 7000 vascular plant observations made in and around Biel/Bienne, Switzerland.
* Part 2 (germination.ipynb) presents a germination experiment with 90 different seeds of different characteristics.
* Part 3 (resources.ipynb) concludes this report, proposes next steps and acknowledges key regional and national resources.

In addition to the usual files, the remainder of the repository is structured as follows:
* The /resources folder stores all of the data and reference files used in this analysis. A list of references used is available in the bibliography. Links to download the reference files used are available in the resources.ipynb file.
* Many source files are stored locally and regularly modified with the results exported to a .csv format in the /resources folder.

## Data
The reference data is drawn from Infoflora, Switzerland's dedicated authority on the conservation of vascular plants: https://www.infoflora.ch/en/.

The raw survey and germination data is available in the resources folder.
